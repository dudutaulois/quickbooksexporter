# 📊 QuickBooks Data Migration Tool (Prototype)

> **⚠️ Important Notice**: This is a **prototype/mockup application** that demonstrates the concept and user interface for a QuickBooks data migration tool. It does not connect to actual QuickBooks data and generates mock CSV files for demonstration purposes only.

## 🎯 Overview

This application showcases how a QuickBooks data migration tool would work, providing users with a step-by-step interface to:

- Simulate secure authentication with QuickBooks
- Select data types for export (customers and invoices)
- Choose destination platforms (Notion or Airtable)
- Generate mock migration packages with sample data
- Provide detailed import instructions

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Simulated Authentication
- Mock OAuth 2.0 flow demonstration
- Security features explanation
- Visual feedback for connection status

### 📋 Data Selection Interface
- Interactive selection of data types
- Visual preview of what will be exported
- Clear explanations of included fields

### 🎯 Platform Selection
- Support for Notion and Airtable
- Platform-specific feature comparisons
- Tailored export formatting

### 📦 Mock Data Generation
- **25 sample customer records** with realistic data
- **50 sample invoice records** with proper relationships
- CSV files formatted for each platform
- Detailed import instructions (README.md)

### 📊 Progress Tracking
- Real-time migration progress simulation
- Step-by-step status updates
- Error handling demonstration

## 📋 Mock Data Structure

### Customer Records
```csv
Customer ID, Customer Name, Contact Name, Email, Phone, Address, City, State, ZIP, Created Date
```

### Invoice Records
```csv
Invoice Number, Customer ID, Customer Name, Invoice Date, Due Date, Amount, Tax Amount, Total Amount, Status, Description, Terms
```

## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or pnpm

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd quickbooks-migration-tool

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## 📝 Usage Flow

1. **Welcome Screen**: Introduction to the migration concept
2. **Authentication**: Simulated QuickBooks connection
3. **Data Selection**: Choose between customers and/or invoices
4. **Platform Selection**: Pick Notion or Airtable as destination
5. **Migration Process**: Watch simulated data extraction and processing
6. **Download Package**: Get ZIP file with mock CSV data and instructions
7. **Completion**: Summary and next steps

## 🎭 What This Prototype Demonstrates

- **User Experience Design** for complex data migration workflows
- **Step-by-step wizard interface** with progress tracking
- **Platform-specific customization** of export formats
- **Security-focused messaging** for user trust
- **Comprehensive documentation** generation
- **Error handling and recovery** scenarios

## ⚠️ Limitations

This is a **demonstration prototype** and has the following limitations:

- ❌ Does not connect to actual QuickBooks APIs
- ❌ Generates mock data instead of real exports
- ❌ No actual authentication with QuickBooks
- ❌ No real data processing or transformation
- ❌ Not suitable for production use

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Conceptual)

If this were to become a real application, potential features could include:

- Real QuickBooks API integration
- Advanced data filtering and customization
- Support for additional platforms (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.)
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Data validation and error reporting
- Scheduled migrations and backups
